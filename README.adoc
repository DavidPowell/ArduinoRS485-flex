= {repository-name} Library for Arduino =

This is a fork of the ArduinoRS485 library, designed for increased flexibility
- The library caller must always instantiate an object of type RS485Class - no default object is created
- No assumptions are made about default pins - this enables the library to compile successfully on many more boards
- The caller specifies which hardware serial port to use, making it easy to change serial ports
